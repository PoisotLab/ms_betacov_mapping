  "abstract": "Driven by the need to understand the ecological factors involved in the emergence of betacoronavirus (the genus causing the SARS and MERS disease in human) through bat hosts, we develop an approach to the assesment of spillover risk based on the Geographic Mosaic Theory of Coevolution. In doing so, we provide a global mapping of the spillover risk posed by betacoronaviruses, reflecting the fact that this risk has many ecological and evolutionary origins. Our framework reveals that reservoir richness alone, although a component of viral hazard, is not a sufficiently integrative predictor of risk. We offer alternative insights based on viral sharing, host compositional uniqueness, and host phylogenetic diversity. By comparing our aggregated measure of risk to a proxy for human density, namely the proportion of each pixel that is covered by urban or built land, we provide a synthetic risk map, allowing the identification of hotspots where the bat-betacoronavirus system may originate novel viruses in humans.",
